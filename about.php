            <p>This application is a simple way to tally up your Snooker scores as you play through your frames. Such is the scale of this application and the planning required, I decided to open this project out to its own repository. - <a href="https://projects.jonniegrieve.co.uk/snooker_scorer" target="_blank">Link</a></p>

            <h3>How to use the app</h3>

            <p>The app is designed to be used in a browser. It is not designed to be used on a mobile device. The app is responsive and will work on any device that supports HTML5 and CSS3.</p>

            <p>The player that makes the break is always "Player 1".</p>

             There will inevitably be frames where a player forfeits the frame and the table is not cleared. There will be occasions where it's not viable for the winning player to clear the table. This is a player forfeit and the current scores are recorded as the final frame score.</p>
            <p>To use the app, you will need to have a Snooker table set up with the following items:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>A red ball</li>
                <li>A black ball</li>
                <li>A green ball</li>
                <li>A yellow ball</li>
                <li>A pink ball</li>
                <li>A blue ball</li>
                <li>A brown ball</li>
